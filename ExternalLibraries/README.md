Files in here are needed to build this.

You have a few options to obtain them:
1. Copy them from Steam/Standalone, you'll need
  * CloudX.Shared.dll
  * CodeX.dll
  * BaseX.dll
2. Run Get.ps1 which is a poweshell script that'll do it for you.

These aren't checked in to the repository because I don't want people being mad.
